# Project Overview
This project involves analyzing customer data for a subscription service to identify  segments and trends. The goal is to understand customer behavior, track subscription types, and identify key trends in cancellations and renewals using EXcel, SQL and Power BI.



# Data Collected
## Data Structure
The dataset includes the following key columns:
1. CustomerID: A unique identifier for each customer.
2. Customer Name: The name of the customer.
3. Region: The geographical area where the customer is located.
4. Subscription Type: The specific category or plan of the subscription chosen by the customer.
5. Subscription Start: The date when the customerâ€™s subscription begins.
6. Subscription End: The date when the subscription is set to expire or has ended
7. Canceled: A flag indicating whether the subscription has been canceled, useful for tracking customer retention.
8. Revenue: The total income generated from the subscription.

### Data Cleaning
The data was cleaned by removing duplicates prior to data analysis. Data cleaning helps eliminate errors and allows for smoother analysis. Thereafter, excel was used to calculate metrics for the data.

# Formula Used
### Subscription Duration
```
=(F2-E2)
```
### Average Subscription Duration
```
=AVERAGE(I2:I33788)
```
### Most popular Subscription Type
To find the most popular subscription type, the COUNTIF function was used to calculate the total number of the three subscription type (Basic, Premium and Standard). The highest subscription count was ranked as the most popular subscription type, which is Basic. 
```
=COUNTIF(D2:D33788,D33776)
=COUNTIF(D2:D33788,D33774)
=COUNTIF(D2:D33788,D33777)
```

# Data Visualization
Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. By using visual elements like charts, graphs, maps, and infographics, data visualization tools and techniques help to make complex data more accessible, understandable, and usable. 

## Pivot Analysis
Pivot analysis is a powerful data analysis technique that allows users to summarize, reorganize, and analyze large datasets. The following metrics was summarized using pivot analysis;

# Structured Query Language (SQL)
Structured Query Language, is a standardized programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases.
SQL was used to analyze customer data. The following query was written to extract key insights. 

Select * from [dbo].[LITA CustomerDATA]

### Total Number of Customers Per Region
```
Select Region, Count(CustomerID) AS Total_Customers
FROM [dbo].[LITA CustomerDATA]
GROUP BY Region
```
![TOTAL NO OF CUSTOMERS PER REGION](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c479b18-86fc-476e-bda5-f77a349b34b3)

### Most Popular SubscriptionType by Customer
```
Select TOP 1 SubscriptionType, Count(CustomerID) AS Total_Customers
FROM [dbo].[LITA CustomerDATA]
GROUP BY SubscriptionType
ORDER BY Total_Customers DESC
```

### Customers who canceled their subscription within 6 months 
```
Select CustomerID, CustomerName, SubscriptionStart, SubscriptionEnd
FROM [dbo].[LITA CustomerDATA]
WHERE Canceled = 1 
AND DATEDIFF(MONTH, SubscriptionStart, SubscriptionEnd) <=6;
```

Where SubscriptionStart IS NOT NULL AND SubscriptionEnd IS NOT NULL
```

### Customers with subscriptions longer than 12 months
```
Select CustomerID, SubscriptionStart, SubscriptionEnd,

# Power BI
Power BI is a data visualization and business intelligence that converts data from different sources to interactive dashboards and business intelligence reports. The customer data was analyzed using power BI to generate key insights on cancellations, subscription trends and interactive analysis.

## Customer Segmentation Dashboard
